JASP Docs
=========

The Juju Application Security Protocol (JASP) uses Mkdocs to generate
documentation. For more information see their website: http://www.mkdocs.org 

To generate the documentation:

     $ mkdocs build

This will create a directory called `site` which has the `index.html`
for viewing in your browser.
